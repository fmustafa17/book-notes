# **Bossed Up - A Grown Woman's Guide to Getting Your Sh*t Together.** *By Emilie Aries*

## *Chapter One:* Combatting the Martyrdom Mindset

- Women tend to role overload, where they put in 100% effort into their careers, relationships and other responsibilities but contribute little to no time for themselves.
- Feelings of guilt and shame towards self care when there is "more important" work to be done.
- To craft your perfect career and life, you have to become clear on what you want for yourself and be assertive on what matters most to you.
- Gender roles for women are set since we were very young - expected to care for others, play nice and be helpful sweethearts. 
- Women are seen as selfish, bossy, braggy, or a bitch if they don't conform to the traditional gender roles.
- Martyrdom mindset - term coined by author.
    - Baggage of female gender roles combined with exhausting work ethic to satisfy everyone and never disappoint anyone, leading to burn out.
    - The underlying belief that success requires suffering and sacrificing yourself for others.
    - Uncomfortable with leisure time.
- People who have a healthier mind and body are able to produce better results. 
    - "You can't pour from an empty cup."
    - Basic self care is a strategic approach to be more productive.
- First acknowledge the martyrdom mindset.
    - "Choosing to live differently is not a rejection, it's an evolution." 
- Psychologist Abraham Maslow hierarchy of needs chart from 'A Theory of Human Motivation':
    - Physiological -> food, water, warmth, rest
    - Safety -> security, health, employment
    - Belonging and Love -> intimate relationships, friends, sense of connection
    - Esteem -> prestige, feeling of accomplishment, respect of others
    - Self-Actualization -> achieving one's full potentional, including creative activities

- Burnout, defined by the World Health Organization, is a mental health disorder with three main symptoms: 
    - physical and emotional exhaustion
    - cynicism and detachment and feelings of ineffectiveness
    - a lack of accomplishment
- 4 main causes of burnout:
    - Lack of agency - outside forces controlling your life. We give up some agency in exchange for something else. (working 9 to 5 daily in exchange for a steady income)
    - No rest - Actively resting (taking a dance class, exercising, painting, playing an instrument) is more rejuvenating than passively resting (scrolling through social media, watching tv)
    - No purpose - you no longer believe in what you're doing with your life. Having a sense of purpose and a goal in life can help keep you engaged and prevent burnout.
    - Lack of community - Friends help ward off stress and decrease the feeling of loneliness.
        > "After graduation, your besties dispersed across the country, and you find yourself struggling to make new friends where you are. You travel for work all the time and wind up alone in your hotel room most nights. You want to go see a movie but can't think of who you might ask to go with you." Taken from the book itself because I relate so much. 
- Striving for sustainable success - investing in your personal substainability is an investment towards your life and your career.
    - Self care = essential maintenence.
    - Putting yourself first is the strategic thing to do.
    - How we treat ourselves is the way how the world sees to treat us. 
    - Set a high bar on how to treat yourself.
