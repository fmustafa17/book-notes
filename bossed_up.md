# **Bossed Up - A Grown Woman's Guide to Getting Your Sh*t Together.** *By Emilie Aries*

## *Chapter One:* Combatting the Martyrdom Mindset

- Women tend to role overload, where they put in 100% effort into their careers, relationships and other responsibilities but contribute little to no time for themselves.
- Feelings of guilt and shame towards self care when there is "more important" work to be done.
- To craft your perfect career and life, you have to become clear on what you want for yourself and be assertive on what matters most to you.
- Gender roles for women are set since we were very young - expected to care for others, play nice and be helpful sweethearts. 
- Women are seen as selfish, bossy, braggy, or a bitch if they don't conform to the traditional gender roles.
- Martyrdom mindset - term coined by author.
    - Baggage of female gender roles combined with exhausting work ethic to satisfy everyone and never disappoint anyone, leading to burn out.
    - The underlying belief that success requires suffering and sacrificing yourself for others.
    - Uncomfortable with leisure time.
- People who have a healthier mind and body are able to produce better results. 
    - "You can't pour from an empty cup."
    - Basic self care is a strategic approach to be more productive.
- First acknowledge the martyrdom mindset.
    - "Choosing to live differently is not a rejection, it's an evolution." 
- Psychologist Abraham Maslow hierarchy of needs chart from 'A Theory of Human Motivation':
    - Physiological -> food, water, warmth, rest
    - Safety -> security, health, employment
    - Belonging and Love -> intimate relationships, friends, sense of connection
    - Esteem -> prestige, feeling of accomplishment, respect of others
    - Self-Actualization -> achieving one's full potentional, including creative activities
    ![Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow-5.jpg)
- Burnout, defined by the World Health Organization, is a mental health disorder with three main symptoms: 
    - physical and emotional exhaustion
    - cynicism and detachment and feelings of ineffectiveness
    - a lack of accomplishment
- 4 main causes of burnout:
    - Lack of agency - outside forces controlling your life. We give up some agency in exchange for something else. (working 9 to 5 daily in exchange for a steady income)
    - No rest - Actively resting (taking a dance class, exercising, painting, playing an instrument) is more rejuvenating than passively resting (scrolling through social media, watching tv)
    - No purpose - you no longer believe in what you're doing with your life. Having a sense of purpose and a goal in life can help keep you engaged and prevent burnout.
    - Lack of community - Friends help ward off stress and decrease the feeling of loneliness.
        > "After graduation, your besties dispersed across the country, and you find yourself struggling to make new friends where you are. You travel for work all the time and wind up alone in your hotel room most nights. You want to go see a movie but can't think of who you might ask to go with you." Taken from the book itself because I relate so much. 
- Striving for sustainable success - investing in your personal substainability is an investment towards your life and your career.
    - Self care = essential maintenence.
    - Putting yourself first is the strategic thing to do.
    - How we treat ourselves is the way how the world sees to treat us. 
    - Set a high bar on how to treat yourself.

## *Chapter Two:* Cultivating Your Boss Identity

- Our identity could be shaped through milestones (sweet sixteen or becoming a manager) and through outside factors (abusive relationship, micromanaging boss)
- Microaggressions - brief and commonplace daily verbal, behaviorial or environmental indignities, intentional or not, that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative racial insults toward people of color.
- Boss identity - retaining ownership and being the boss over your life.
    - owning your power
    - knowing your worth
    - actively crafting your life and career
- Practice makes perfect; carving your boss identity is an iterative process.
    - Act
    - See the response
    - Adjust according to feedback 
- Example: Calling a meeting to address a workplace concern.
    - Do the action: Addressing a concern you deem important and want the team to buy in
    - Feedback Phase: Coworkers can show up to the meeting and take it seriously OR not show up/care, might be met with resistance or people pushing back.
- Your boss identity is built on your actions + the responses you get from the actions.
- Take risks and win the respect of your colleagues.
- Establish your boss identity for confidence and growth
    - Find and create a safe identity workspace to experiment in.
        - You're less likely to take risks in a toxic work environment or in an abusive relationship.
    - Take purposeful action
        - Assert yourself however you can.
    - Gauge reaction
        - Sit back and watch what happens, don't coerce the response.
    - Internalize
        - Subconsciously or not, the reaction sticks with you. Positive -> builds upon your sense as a leader. Negative -> decreases the likelihood of ever asserting yourself again
        - Identify *why* the reaction happened
        - When faced with failure after making a boss move, what external factors contributed that were not in your control?
- When you practice leadership in one part of your life, it's easy to take that confidence with you to the workplace.
- Imposter syndrome - fear of someone accusing you of being a fraud with no credientials, while having trouble internalizing your own successes.
    - Internalizing your failures and then crediting external factors to your successes. (e.g. I got lucky)
- How to beat back the imposter syndrome and get back to making boss moves:
    - Phone a friend. Get someone else's input on a scenerio in which you worry you're not qualified to even try for.
    - Rewrite the story. Identify the negative self-talk and write yourself a better story. Instead of pain and anxiety, work towards that calm confidence.
    - Ask "Why not me?" Focus your energy on what makes you worthwhile and uniquely prepared to take the challenge on.
- Stereotype threat - women spend energy worrying about proving negative stereotypes right. As a result, women often do underperform due to being reminded of the negative stereotype.

- Coping Mechanism #1:
    - Imagine yourself as risk taking and competitive before engaging in a task with potential stereotype threat. 
    - Avoid viewing yourself with a gender lens (e.g "I'm the only woman in this meeting")
    - Focus on your accomplishments, achievements and abilities. 
- Coping Mechanism #2:
    - Use humor to help ease anxiety and help you realize how ridiculous sexism is.
- Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAGs) - having long term ambitions no matter how impractical, that motivate people.
- Thinking/Writing exercise: on a piece of paper write out a journal entry that starts with "I'm so happy now that I have ..." and write about your dreams without any logical steps to achieve them. Get experimentational and playful. Take about 10 minutes.
    - If you're unsure: 
        - Get a peice of paper and play pretend. If you're not liking this vision, scrap the paper and try another scenerio. Change your entire vision around. 
        - After getting all ideas down, check for commonalities. What theme stuck and figure out what lights you up.
    - If you started planning right away:
        - In a few more chapters, will start to plan out the course to success after steering in the right direction first.
    - If you're totally intimidated:
        - "Vision vertigo" - like standing on top of the mountain and looking down.
        - Discomfort is a sign for growth. 
        - Anxieties about the future are normal.
        - "You can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love." - Jim Carrey
- Your ambitions will get clearer over time as you continue to think about what it is that you want. Iterative process just like your boss identity.
